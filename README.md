# ServerClientLib
It is a basic Server-Client library, instances of which you might find on the Internet in countless and various implementations. 
So here is one more) I need it for several projects, so I decided to make it a bit more universal and if you find it usefull in any kind of things you want to do, it is wonderfull. In src you would find `Server` and `Client` parts and `Server-` and `Client-main.cpp` with basic multiconnectional echo server. Merge requests are welcomed.
    Your's WR.
